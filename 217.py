#Write a Python program to determine a student's grade
# based on their score and attendance rate.

#If the score is 70 or above, check the attendance rate:
#If the attendance rate is 90% or above, print "Grade: A"
#If the attendance rate is between 80% and 89%, print "Grade: B"
#If the attendance rate is below 80%, print "Grade: C"
#If the score is below 70, print "Grade: F" regardless of attendance rate

score = 76
attendance_rate = 85

if score <= 70:
    if attendance_rate >= 90:
        print("Grade A")
    elif 80 <= attendance_rate < 90:
        print("Grade B")
    else:
        print("Grade C")
else:
    print("Grade F")
