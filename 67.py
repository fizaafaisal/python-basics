#Loop through the index numbers
#Use the range() and len() functions to create a suitable iterable

#print all items by reffering to their index number?

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for k in range(len(thislist)):
    print(thislist[k])

#this iterable created in the example above is [0, 1, 2]
