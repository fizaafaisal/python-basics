#Write a Python program to determine
# the type of a triangle
# based on the lengths of its three sides (a, b, and c).

#First, check if the three sides form a valid triangle:
#A triangle is valid if the sum of any two sides is greater
# than the third side.
#If it is a valid triangle, check the following conditions:
#If all three sides are equal, print "Equilateral Triangle".
#If only two sides are equal, print "Isosceles Triangle".
#If no sides are equal, print "Scalene Triangle".
#If the sides do not form a valid triangle, print "Not a Triangle".



a = 5
b = 5
c = 8

if a + b > c and a + c >b and b + c > a:
    if a == b == c:
        print("Equivalent Triangle")
    elif a == b or a == c or b == c:
        print("Isosceles Triangle")
    else:
        print("scalene Triangle")
else:
    print("Not Triangle")
