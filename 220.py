#Use not to ensure that the person does not have any unpaid debts.
#Use or to add an alternative condition that will pass if the person has a loyalty card, even if they donâ€™t meet the income and employment criteria.
#If any of these conditions are met, print "Offer Granted!", otherwise print "No Offer".
