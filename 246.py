#Task: Write a Python function called track_scores
#Create a function that can take an arbitrary number of game scores as arguments.
# The function should print:

# The highest score.
# The lowest score.
# The total number of scores provided.
# If no scores are provided, it should print: "No scores to track."
# Call the function with the scores 45, 67, and 89.

def track_scores(*scores):
    if not scores:
        print("No scores to track")
    else:
        highest_score = max(scores)
        lowest_scores = min(scores)
        total_scores = len(scores)

        print(f"highest score: {highest_score}")
        print(f"lowest score: {lowest_scores}")
        print(f"total number of scores: {total_scores}")

track_scores(45, 67, 98)
