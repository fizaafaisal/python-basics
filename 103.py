#Update Tuples

#change tuple values
#once a tuple is created , you cannot change its value.
#Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called.

# you can convert the tuple into a list,
# change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.

#convert the tuple into a list to be able to change it?

x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(x)
y[1] = "kiwi"
x = tuple(y)

print(x)
