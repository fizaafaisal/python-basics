#Python User input

#That means we are able to ask the user for input.
#python 3.6 uses the input() method .
#python 2.7 uses the raw_input() method.
# The following example asks for the username,
# and when you entered the username, it gets printed on the screen:

username = input("Enter username:")
print("Username is: " + username)
