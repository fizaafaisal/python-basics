# check if a number x is between two other numbers y and z (inclusive).
# Additionally, check if x is not equal to a given number k.

#Use and to ensure x is between y and z.
#Use not to ensure x is not equal to k.
#Use or to add an alternative condition
# that will pass if x is exactly twice the value of k.
#If the conditions are met,
# print "Conditions are met!",
# otherwise print "Conditions are not met!".

x = 33

if (y <= x <= z and x != k) or x == 2 * k:
    print("condition are met")
else:
    print("Condition not met")



#First Condition: (y <= x <= z and x != k)

#y <= x: This checks if y (10) is less than or equal to x (25),
# which is True.

#x <= z: This checks if x (25) is less than or equal to z (30),
# which is also True.

#Therefore, y <= x <= z evaluates to True.

#x != k: This checks if x (25) is not equal to k (12), which is True.
#Since both parts of the and condition are True, the entire first condition evaluates to True.



#Second Condition: x == 2 * k

#This checks if x (25) is equal to 2 * k (which is 2 * 12 = 24).
#This is False since 25 is not equal to 24.
