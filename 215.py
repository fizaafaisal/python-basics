#Write a Python program to check if a person qualifies

#Use and to check if the person is at least 18 years old
# and has a valid membership.
#Use not to ensure the person does not have an expired membership.
#Use or to add an alternative condition that will
# pass if the person has a valid referral code,
# even if they don’t meet the age requirement.
#If any of these conditions are met,
# print "Discount Applied!", otherwise print "No Discount".

    # (age >= 18 and has_membership and not membership_expired):
    # This checks if the individual is at least 18 years old,
    # has a membership, and that the membership is not expired.
    # All three conditions must be true
    # for this part of the condition to evaluate to True.

    # or has_referral_code:
    # This checks if the individual has a referral code.
    # If this condition is true,
    # the overall condition will be true regardless of the previous part.
