# write a python program:
#initialize a variable n with the value 1.

#uses  a while loop to print the value of n as
# long as n is less than or equal to 8.

#Exits the loop if n is equal to 5 using the break statement.

#in each iteration, increase the value of n by 1.
n = 1

while n <= 8:
    print(n)
    if (n == 5):
        break
    n += 1
