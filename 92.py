#Create Tuple with one Item

#To create a tuple with only one item,
# you have to add a comma after the item,
# otherwise python will not recogonise it as a tuple.

#One item tuple, ramember the coma:
thistuple = ("apple",)
print(type(thistuple))

#Not a tuple
thistuple1 = ("apple")
print(type(thistuple1))
